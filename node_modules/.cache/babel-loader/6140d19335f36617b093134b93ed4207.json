The whole solar system revolves around a common point, including the Sun. For the earth and the moon, the barycenter is inside the earth, about $1700\\\\ km$ inside the earth\\u2019s surface. As for the solar system, the barycenter changes its location, which depends upon the instantaneous location of all the planets.

This implies that the speed needs to be larger when it is closer to the Sun and slower if the planet is farther from it. Therefore, the speed of the earth is highest in January and slowest in July.
