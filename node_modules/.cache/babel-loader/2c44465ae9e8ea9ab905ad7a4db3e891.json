The whole solar system revolves around a common point, including the sun. For the earth and the moon the barycenter is inside the earth, about $1700\\\\ km$ inside the earth\\u2019s surface. As for the solar system, the barycenter changes it location which depends upon the instantaneous location of all the planets.
